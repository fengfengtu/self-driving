    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",

    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model is based on the nvidia model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316), which consists of a convolution neural network with 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. (model.py lines 137-154) \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three convolutional layers use a 5x5 filter and a 2x2 stride, and the remaining two convolutional layers use a 3x3 filter and 1x1 stride.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model includes RELU layers to introduce nonlinearity (code lines 139-154), and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer (code line 138). The model also includes a cropping layer to remove the top unwanted section of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested the model with and without the dropout layers (model.py lines 140, 142, 144, 146, 148). Because the data augmentation is also a way to avoid overfitting, in this project, I didn't find overfitting problem with or without the drop layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 71). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 156).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to start with a tried and proven network such as LeNet 5, AlexNet, VGG, etc, and build upon it. I then come across the nvidia network which was used in a very similar scenario and the network is a simple one, so I decided to give it a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I ran the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. It drove ok until it fell off the track at the relatively sharp turn after the bridge. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I chose a bunch of data augmentation methods such as adding the left/right camera images and tuning the angle correction parameter, adding the horizontal/vertical shift of the image, adding random shadow and changing the brightness of the images. After the data augmentation, the model runs quite well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also experimented with adding a dropout layer with 0.50 prob after each convolutional layer but there's no noticeable improvement both in terms of loss and the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 137-154) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes:\n",

It would cause the model to bias toward 0, therefore, I removed the data with angles smaller than 1. The original distribution and after distribution are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image8]\n",
    "![alt text][image9]\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would balance the training data such that it does not skew toward either left or right turns. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:\n",
